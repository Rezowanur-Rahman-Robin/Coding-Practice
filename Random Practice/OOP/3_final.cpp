/*
The compiler performs its job neatly. It complains that the method h in the class Base (line 2) is overridden by the method in class Derived (line 10). Of course, it’s okay that the method h (line 13) in class Derived overloads h for the parameter type double. This method g (line 15) in the class Derived is quite interesting. The method overrides the method g (line 4) of the class Base and declares the method final. Therefore, g cannot be overridden in DerivedDerived (line 19).

DerivedClass cannot be derived from FinalClass, because the FinalClass is final.
